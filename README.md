Welcome to the **React LaTeX Formula Converter** — a fast, user-friendly tool designed to help students, educators, and developers effortlessly convert plain text math expressions into beautifully rendered LaTeX formulas. Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, this project leverages **better-react-mathjax** for real-time rendering and offers a responsive keyboard for quick formula input. 🧮⚛️

## 🎯 Why This Project?

Math and science students, especially at institutions like **UNICAMP** 🎓, often face challenges typing complex mathematical formulas online. This converter bridges the gap between intuitive text input and precise LaTeX rendering, making it ideal for courses such as **Fundamentos Matemáticos (MC358)** 📐 and **Cálculo Avançado (MC458)** ➗.

Whether you’re preparing homework 📚, academic papers 📝, or interactive learning materials 💡, this tool simplifies formula creation and live preview with minimal latency.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ **Live LaTeX rendering** with MathJax for instant preview.
- ⏳ **Debounced input handling** for smooth typing experience.
- 🎹 **Custom math keyboard** to insert common mathematical symbols.
- 📋 **Copy to clipboard** functionality for easy sharing.
- 📱 Responsive and accessible UI built with modern React hooks and TypeScript.
- 🔧 Optimized for both beginners and advanced LaTeX users.
